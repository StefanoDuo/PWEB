		<h1>Objective</h1>
		<p><span class="playerTutorial inline"></span> That's you, an adventurer in search of fortune.</p>
		<p>Your quest is to push this <span class="ballTutorial inline"></span> chest full of treasures into the <span class="holeTutorial inline"></span> hole which leads out of the level.</p>
		<p>Be careful once you push the chest it will travel until it hits a <span class="rockTutorial inline"></span> rock or the walls of the level.</p>
		<p>Every action increases your score, and the lower the score the better, therefore think carefully before acting.</p>

	<div class="card">
		<h1>Controls</h1>
		<p>Use <kbd class="kbd">W</kbd><kbd class="kbd">A</kbd><kbd class="kbd">S</kbd><kbd class="kbd">D</kbd> to move.</p>
		<p><kbd class="kbd">Q</kbd> undoes your last move, you can keep going back until there are actions to undo.</p>
		<p>Until you make a new move you can redo the actions you've undone with <kbd class="kbd">E</kbd>.</p>
		<p>To help you keep track of your previous moves there can be up to 5 arrows representing the direction your character
			will move if you press <kbd class="kbd">Q</kbd>, the same goes for the redoable actions.</p>
		<p>The arrow at the top is the first move that will be undone.</p>
		<p>If the arrow has an orange background then the ball will move instead of your character.</p>
		<p><kbd class="kbd">R</kbd> resets the level to its starting configuration.</p>
