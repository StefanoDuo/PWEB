---------------- FEATURES ----------------
LEVEL PAGE
1) after beating a level if the player isn't logged in save the score in the local storage and
   show a message explaining to log in if willing to save the score, offering a link to login
   or register page that will redirect the user back to the level page after completing the task
2) show next level button which pick 1 level that the player has yet to beat
3) add visual score, undo, redo moves tracker

REPLAY PAGE
1) make PAUSE/START buttons unclickable when it makes sense
2) add visual score, undo, redo moves tracker

GAME OBJECT
1) allow saving current game status to resume gameplay later

DATABASE
1) modify beatenBy primary key adding a timestamp, so a player can save multiple scores for a single level

---------------- REFACTORING ----------------
GAME OBJECT
1) create status object to send minimal information to the Sketcher object
3) foreseeing the change on the sketching animation, instantly calculate the
   ball ending position and apply it, leaving the motion to the transition
   or transform animation, this fixes as well the problem with the ball and
   player moving at the same time and the undo/redo actions

SKETCHER OBJECT
2) rework how the drawing works, the rocks hole and basic grid in sketched
   only once during the initialization,
   the player and the ball instead are 2 divs which class gets changed
   resulting in the moving with transitions and absolute positioning,
   (probably needs parent element realitively positioned)

MERGE REPLAY AND LEVEL PAGE
1) given that they do the same thing (only the source of input changes) think of a way to merge them without increasing
the code complexity too much, so we don't need to duplicate our code
2) otherwise think of a way to better modularize the code and keep them as 2 seprated pages

DATABASE OBJECT
3)add tests for the methods (getUser, insertLevel, insertUser done)
