SKETCHER OBJECT ---- BACKGROUNDSKETCHER
1) the sketcher will only handle the static grid tiles (rocks and the hole)
	and the level creation in the workshop page
2) allow rectangular shapes (needed for the new object)

NEW OBJECT ---- FOREGROUNDSKETCHER
1) handles the player and ball tiles which are always the same divs
	the movement is done by changing their css class with different
	absolute positioning + transitions (probably needs parent element
	realitively positioned)
2) there's actually no need to create 2 different "classes" we can just instantiate
	2 different objects, 1 for the background grid, one for the moving elements
