GAME OBJECT (features)
1) create status object to send minimal information to the Sketcher object
2) let the player move while the ball is moving (always move the ball first
	to avoid strange behaviour)
4) foreseeing the change on the sketching animation, instantly calculate the
   ball ending position and apply it, leaving the motion to the transition
   or transform animation, this fixes as well the problem with the ball and
   player moving at the same time and the undo/redo actions

SKETCHER OBJECT (features)
2) rework how the drawing works, the rocks hole and basic grid in sketched
	only once during the initialization,
	the player and the ball instead are 2 divs which class gets changed
	resulting in the moving with transitions and absolute positioning,
	probably needs parent element realitively positioned

DATABASE OBJECT (php)
3)add tests for the methods (getUser, insertLevel, insertUser done)


LEVEL PAGE
1) after beating a level
   a) submit the score with an ajax request if the player is logged in ------ DONE
   b) save the score in the local storage and show a message explaining to log in if willing to
   save the score, offering a link to login or register page that will redirect the user back
   to the level page after completing the task
   c) show next level button which pick 1 level that the player has yet to beat

   to check if the user is logged in we search for the profile tab (element with id nickname)
2) allow replay playback or create another page to see them
