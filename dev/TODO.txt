GAME OBJECT
1) add the ballMovingDirection vector to the state object so when undoing during ball movements and then redoing the ball will start moving again

REPLAY PAGE
1) fix the replay previous button
2) the ball keeps moving even when pressing the previous button because if isBallMoving() returns true the input isn't read, actually not even extracted from the stack

"ADVANCED STUFF"

USER PAGE
1) add the custom keybindings option

---------------- REFACTORING ----------------
GAME OBJECT
1) refactor the collision logic, just make 1 single method that receives a position and a moving direction, it returns false if nothing has been hit and the name of the object hit if something is hit


SKETCHER OBJECT ---- BACKGROUNDSKETCHER
1) the sketcher will only handle the static grid tiles (rocks and the hole)
	and the level creation in the workshop page
2) allow rectangular shapes (needed for the new object)

NEW OBJECT ---- FOREGROUNDSKETCHER
1) handles the player and ball tiles which are always the same divs
	the movement is done by changing their css class with different
	absolute positioning + transitions (probably needs parent element
	realitively positioned)
2) there's actually no need to create 2 different "classes" we can just instantiate
	2 different objects, 1 for the background grid, one for the moving elements
