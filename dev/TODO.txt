GAME OBJECT (features)
1) create status object to send minimal information to the Sketcher object
2) let the player move while the ball is moving (always move the ball first
	to avoid strange behaviour)
3) add score tracking

SKETCHER OBJECT (features)
2) rework how the drawing works, the rocks hole and basic grid in sketched
	only once during the initialization,
	the player and the ball instead are 2 divs which class gets changed
	resulting in the moving with transitions and absolute positioning,
	probably needs parent element realitively positioned

DATABASE OBJECT (php)
2) the levelObject stored in the db as json must be retrieved from:
	- an invisible input element in the value field
	- the url
	- Ajax call
3)add tests for the methods (getUser, insertLevel, insertUser done)

GAME OBJECT (refactoring)
2) undo commands implemented, redo still missing

GAME PAGE
1) create button to start the setInterval and event to stop it
