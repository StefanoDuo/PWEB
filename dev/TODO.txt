---------------- FEATURES ----------------
LEVEL PAGE
2) add visual undo, redo moves tracker

"ADVANCED STUFF"

PLAY PAGE
1) allow saving current game status to resume gameplay later
2) after beating a level if the player isn't logged in save the score in the local storage and
   show a message explaining to log in if willing to save the score, offering a link to login
   or register page that will redirect the user back to the level page after completing the task

USER PAGE
1) add the custom keybindings option

WORKSHOP PAGE
1)when submitting a level check if the level is beatable, initially the algorithm can even be a brute force method :
	- mark the current location as visited
	- move in every possible direction (recursion)
	- if the ball eventually lands in the hole OK, otherwise the algorithm ends when all the possible location have
		been visited --> returns false

---------------- REFACTORING ----------------
GAME OBJECT
1) refactor to implement the new sketching mechanic

SKETCHER OBJECT ---- BACKGROUNDSKETCHER
1) the sketcher will only handle the static grid tiles (rocks and the hole)
	and the level creation in the workshop page
2) allow rectangular shapes (needed for the new object)

NEW OBJECT ---- FOREGROUNDSKETCHER
1) handles the player and ball tiles which are always the same divs
	the movement is done by changing their css class with different
	absolute positioning + transitions (probably needs parent element
	realitively positioned)
2) there's actually no need to create 2 different "classes" we can just instantiate
	2 different objects, 1 for the background grid, one for the moving elements

GAME OBJECT
1) the getGrid() method is used to give the total layout of the grid (used by the
	sketcher object to draw the grid initially)
1) create a new method to send just the ball and player movements + other info
	if needed (this will be used by the new object to animate them)
3) instantly calculate the ball ending position and apply it, leaving the
	motion to the transition or transform animation, this fixes as well the
	problem with the ball and player moving at the same time and the undo/redo actions

MERGE REPLAY AND LEVEL PAGE (probably no need to merge them)
1) given that they do the same thing (only the source of input changes) think of a way to merge them without increasing
the code complexity too much, so we don't need to duplicate our code --- BEST DONE AFTER SKETCHER + VISUAL REFACTORING
2) otherwise think of a way to better modularize the code and keep them as 2 seprated pages
