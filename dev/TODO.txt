GAME OBJECT (features)
1) create status object to send minimal information to the Sketcher object
2) let the player move while the ball is moving (always move the ball first
	to avoid strange behaviour)
3) add score tracking

SKETCHER OBJECT (features)
2) rework how the drawing works, the rocks hole and basic grid in sketched
	only once during the initialization,
	the player and the ball instead are 2 divs which class gets changed
	resulting in the moving with transitions and absolute positioning,
	probably needs parent element realitively positioned


DATABASE OBJECT (php)
2) the levelObject stored in the db as json must be retrieved from:
	- an invisible input element in the value field
	- the url
	- Ajax call
3)add tests for the methods (getUser, insertLevel, insertUser done)

GAME OBJECT (refactoring)
1) move player must accept strings instead of Vector objects
2) create an object or function inside to map the string to a Vector and keep track
	of movement history to implement undo and redo commands

INPUT OBJECT (refactoring)
1) refactor as a standalone module which accepts an array containing
	the IDs of the elements to listen and optional an array which maps
    keyCodes to strings (if not present it doesn't allow requesting strings
    instead of keyCodes)
2) the interface of the object must offer those methods
	- setTranslator(translator)
    - getPressedKeyCodes()
    - getPressedTranslations()
    - getPriorityKeyCode()
    - getPriorityTranslation()
3) the constructor must accept either an array of objects each containing
	- whereToListen string
    - queue to store the priority of the pressed keyCodes
    - translator

QUEUE OBJECT (refactoring)
1) change Queue implementation with the one commented at the bottom

GAME PAGE
1) create button to start the setInterval and event to stop it
